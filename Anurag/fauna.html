					<h1><a href="#">Fauna</a></h1>
					<p> Fauna is all of the animal life present in a particular region or time.
                         The corresponding term for plants is flora, and for fungi, it is funga. 
                         Flora, fauna, funga and other forms of life are collectively referred to as biota.
                          Zoologists and paleontologists use fauna to refer to a typical collection of animals found in a specific time or place, 
                          e.g. the "Sonoran Desert fauna" or the "Burgess Shale fauna". Paleontologists sometimes refer to a sequence of faunal stages, 
                          which is a series of rocks all containing similar fossils. The study of animals of a particular region is called faunistics..</p>

							<h3>Fauna as an important resources</h3>
							<p>Fauna represents the animal life indigenous to a region. There are many explanations regarding the origin of the word. As per Roman mythology, Fauna or “Faunus” is the name of the goddess of fertility. Another source is “Fauns” which means “Forest spirits.“

                                Animal kingdom comprises a variety of animal life forms. Hence, the classification of fauna is much more complex than the floral division. Therefore, for ease of classification;
                                
                                Birds are categorized under the name Avifauna.
                                Fishes under Pisci Fauna.
                                Microorganisms including bacteria and virus are generally considered under animal kingdom, they are known as Microfauna.
                                All unknown and undiscovered animals are named as cryptofauna.
                                 The earth is beautiful because of all these life forms. 
                                 Other life forms depend on them for various resources and exploit them.

                                  Conservation of flora and fauna is thus necessary for future survival. 
                                  Biosphere reserves, national parks, zoos and sanctuaries are a few instances of the measures taken by the government for conservation of flora and fauna.
                                   Another example is the Tiger project launched by the Government of India with the goal of saving the tigers in the country from extinction. </p>

							<h3>Types Of Fauna Found On Earth </h3>
							<p> Herbivores:
                                Any animal that only eats plants would be classified as a herbivore.
                                Just because they don't eat meat doesn't mean all herbivores are small. 
                                Guinea pigs, rabbits, snails and butterflies are good examples of small herbivores, but horses, cows, zebras, deer and elephants are also herbivores.
                                 In prehistoric times, many dinosaurs fed only on plants, and these reached gigantic dimensions. Many different kinds of animals can be herbivores, including mammals, insects, worms, invertebrates, and even some birds.

                                 Carnivores:
                                 Any animal that feeds only on meat is classified as a carnivore.
                                 Carnivores often have sharper teeth or even fangs to help tear meat.
                                 Most of the time in their ecosystem, carnivores will hunt herbivores, although they may eat omnivores or even other carnivores depending on what food is available. Small animals can include spiders, frogs and bats.
                                 Medium-sized carnivores can include larger birds such as eagles and hawks, snakes and anteaters.
                                 Large beasts range from wild dogs and wolves to large predators such as lions, tigers or crocodiles.

                                 Omnivores:
                                  Any animal that can eat both plants and animals is an omnivore.
                                   Humans are omnivores with flat and sharp teeth and the ability to digest meat, fruits and vegetables as food. Bears are another example of omnivores because they eat both berries and meat.
                                    Medium-sized omnivores include animals such as raccoons, pigs and chickens.
