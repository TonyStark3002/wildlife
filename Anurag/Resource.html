					<p> Resources –
                        Everything available in our environment which can be used to satisfy our needs, and it is technologically accessible, economically feasible and culturally acceptable can be termed as ‘Resource.
                        Classification of resources –
                        (a) On the basis of origin – biotic and abiotic
                        (b) On the basis of exhaustibility – renewable and non-renewable
                        (c) On the basis of ownership – individual, community, national and international (d) On the basis of status of development – potential, developed stock and reserves.  </p>

							<h3>Types Of Resources On the basis of Exhaustability </h3>
							<p> On the Basis of Exhaustibility
                                1. Renewable Resources:
                                - The resources can be renewed or reproduced by physical, chemical or
                                mechanical processes.
                                - For example, solar and wind energy, water, forests and wildlife, etc.
                                2. Non-Renewable Resources:
                                - Takes millions of years in their formation.
                                - Some of the resources like metals are recyclable and some like fossil fuels
                                cannot be recycled and get exhausted with their use.
                                - Minerals and fossil fuels are examples of such resources.</p>

							<h3>Types Of Resource on the basis of Status of Development </h3>
							<p> 1. Potential Resources:
                                - Resources which are found in a region, but have not been utilised.
                                - For example, the western parts of India particularly Rajasthan and Gujarat
                                have enormous potential for the development of wind and solar energy, but
                                so far these have not been developed properly.
                                2. Developed Resources:
                                - Resources which are surveyed and their quality and quantity have been determined for utilisation.
                                - The development of resources depends on technology and level of their feasibility.
                                3. Stock:
                                - Materials in the environment which have the potential to satisfy human needs
                                but human beings do not have the appropriate technology to access these, are
                                included among stock.
                                - For example, water is a compound of two inflammable gases; hydrogen and
                                oxygen, which can be used as a rich source of energy.
                                - But we do not have the required technical ‘know-how’ to use them for this
                                purpose. Hence, it can be considered as stock.
                                4. Reserves
                                - These are the subset of the stock, which can be put into use with the help of existing technical ‘know-how’ but their use has not been started.These can be used for meeting future requirements.
                                - For example - River water can be used for generating hydroelectric power but presently, it is being utilised only to a limited extent. 
                                Thus, the water in the dams, forests etc. is a reserve which can be used in the future
                                </p>
