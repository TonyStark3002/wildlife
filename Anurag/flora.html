					<h1><a href="#">Flora</a></h1>
					<p>The term flora in Latin means “Goddess of the Flower.” Flora is a collective term for a group of plant life found in a particular region. The whole plant kingdom is represented by this name.

						Flora is classified and differentiated based on many factors. The best one among them is the area in which they grow or are found. Some grow in desert regions or in water, some are found in hilly areas while some are endemic to a specific geographic location.
						
						According to the place at which they grow, they have adaptations also. For example, Cactus plants are naturally seen in deserts. They have adaptations like modified leaves or prickles to preserve water and protect themselves from predators.
						
						The agricultural flora consists of plants cultivated by men for their use. Horticulture is the practice of growing ornamental and decorative flowers, which are also known as garden flora.</p>

							<h3>Flora as an important resources</h3>
							<p>In 1992, around 7,43,534 km2 of land in the country was under forests of which 92 percent belongs to the government. Only 22.7 percent is forested compared to the recommended 33 percent of the National Forest Policy Resolution 1952. The majority of it are broad-leaved deciduous trees which comprise one-sixth sal and one-tenth teak. Coniferous types are found in the northern high altitude regions and comprise pines, junipers and deodars.[2] India's forest cover ranges from the tropical rainforest of the Andaman Islands, Western Ghats, and Northeast India to the coniferous forest of the Himalaya. Between these extremes lie the sal-dominated moist deciduous forest of eastern India; teak-dominated dry deciduous forest of central and southern India; and the babul-dominated thorn forest of the central Deccan and western Gangetic plain. Pine, fir, spruce, cedar, larch and cypress are the timber-yielding plants of which several also occur widely in the hilly regions of India</p>

							<h3>Soil</h3>
							<p> In the ancient period, soils were mainly classified into two – Urvara (fertile) and Usara (sterile).

								The first scientific classification of soil was done by Vasily Dokuchaev.  In India, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has classified soils into 8 categories. They are:
								
								Alluvial Soil
								Black Cotton Soil
								Red & Yellow Soil
								Laterite Soil
								Mountainous or Forest Soil
								Arid or Desert Soil
								Saline and Alkaline Soil
								Peaty and Marshy Soil
								As mentioned before, there are eight types of soils categorized by ICAR but some Indian Soils like – Karewa soil, Sub-Montane Soil, Snowfield, Grey/Brown Soil are all sub-types of main Indian Soil. Let’s read about them one by one:
								  Types of Soil in India – Alluvial Soil
								Alluvial soils are widespread in the northern plains and river valleys.
								It covers about 40% of the total land area of the country. 
								These soils are mainly derived from the debris brought down from the Himalayas.
								In the Peninsular region, they are found in deltas of the east coast and in the river valleys.
								 Also known as the “omnibus group”.
								It covers about 18.5 % of the total land area of the country.
								It is found in regions of low rainfall (eastern and southern parts of the Deccan Plateau). Along the piedmont zone of the Western Ghats, a long stretch of area is occupied by red loamy soil. This soil is also present in parts of Odisha and Chattisgarh and in the southern parts of the Middle Ganga Plain.
								 Types of Soil in India – Desert Soil
								Desert Soil
								Also known as arid soil, it accounts for over 4.42 % of the total land area of the country. 
								The colour ranges from red to brown.
								Desert soils are sandy to gravelly in texture, have low moisture content and low water-retaining capacity.
								These soils are saline in nature and in certain regions the salt content is so high that common salt is obtained by evaporating water.
								These soils have normal phosphate content but are deficient in nitrogen.</p>
